    "The purpose of this tutorial is to provide an example use case for training a BioNeMo large language model using the BioNeMo framework. In this tutorial, you will gain experience in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocessing the UniRef50 and UniRef90 data for ESM-2nv.\n",

    "### Overview - ESM-2nv Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**ESM-2nv** is based on the public ESM-2 model, which is a BERT architecture trained on millions of protein sequences from the UniProt database. ESM-2nv learns the patterns and dependencies between amino acids that ultimately give rise to a protein’s 2D structure. These can include properties such as alpha helix or beta sheet, as well as cellular location, thermostability, solubility, and other protein properties. For more information, check the [ESM-2nv model card](../models/esm2-nv.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ESM-2nv model training example walkthrough will show how to utilize compute resources, download and preprocess datasets, and perform model training on single and multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained on UniRef50 and UniRef90 protein sequences, truncated to a maximum length of 1022 amino acids.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "Ensure that you have read through the [Getting Started](../index.md) section, can run the BioNeMo Framework Docker container, and have configured the NGC Command Line Interface (CLI) within the container. It is assumed that this notebook is being executed from within the container. Additionally, this tutorial depends on the [ESM-2nv](../models/esm2-nv.md) model.\n",

This helps in capturing diverse features and patterns that are relevant for protein function and structure prediction, while also preventing overfitting and improving generalization.
